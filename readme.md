## Usage

Add the Betterdiscord plugin to your discord client. It will make the emotes of of discord larger and easier to read. This is important for the OCR to work effectively.

Then run the project. It will take a snipit of the discord window and then use OCR to read the cards. It will then count the cards and display the count.
